# Drinkpedia

Drinkpedia is a webapp developed by Natalia Nossak and me, Matheu Chaves. This is the second project made to our Web Dev Bootcamp at Iron Hack.
In this project we could test our knowledge working with React and API's. To build this project we used React Bootstrap for some components and Axios to consume de Api, but also, the majority of the project styles were made with vanilla CSS.

# The Project

Drinkpedia was born to help people find drinks to enjoy moments with friends, family and have a good time. In the app the user can seacrh in a wide variety
of drinks, from the most famous and iconic drinks to the unimagible ones. 

# Usage

In the main page of the app the user will find alcoholic and non-alcoholic drink recipes. There is also a seacrh bar, 
to search for a recipe, simply enter the name or ingredient of the desired drink in the search bar and click the "Search" button. The search results will be displayed in cards, with the image and name of the drink. 
By clicking on a card, you will be directed to the recipe details page, where you will find the list of ingredients and preparation instructions.

If the user is completly new to this world and has no idea where to begin, we provided in the main page a section to get a recomended drink, clicking in the button the user will be redirected to a random recipe with ingridients and full instructions.
